1. Support DVD directories

   Right now it works a little bit. But if a dir is a DVD dump, there
   is no inotify support in the VIDEO_TS subdir.

2. Update doc

3. Fix udisk support, add rom drive speed and let the application
   mount/umount. Right now the complete non-root media support is
   broken and deactivated.

4. Move special_exts in File._beacon_mtime to kaa.metadata

5. Use inotify on overlay directories. Or maybe remove the overlay
   stuff completly. I do not think it is used anywhere. This would
   speed up beacon.

6. Try to reduce algorithm complexity in certain places.  e.g. maybe Query
   objects keep a dict of items keyed on url rather than a sorted item list.

7. Ability to give changes back to the caller in stages; useful for doing
   live queries while a user is typing in a word.

8. When an image is deleted, beacon should delete any corresponding thumbnail.

9. Subject: Music: cover art per album
   To: freevo-users@lists.sourceforge.net
   Date: Mon Oct 30 19:32:32 2006 +0100

   Freevo is currently looking for a cover.jpg or (filename).jpg file
   to display as cover art. However, it would be great if it can also
   look for files called (ID3AlbumName).jpg. This will allow users to
   store music from several albums in a single directory.

A. Put new/changed files discovered by inotify at the top of the scan queue.

B. Item object should offer mimetype attribute.

C. Change the Item API, e.g. make scanned either a property or rename it to
   is_scanned.

D. Parse image tags into the database and add query on tags
